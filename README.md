This asteroid evasion game is inspired by the 1979 video game called "Asteroids." The player controls a small spaceship that is surrounded by a field of flying asteroids. The spaceship can only turn left (left arrow key), turn right (right arrow key), and accelerate (up arrow key). No reverse key makes the game challenging and more accurate to the physics of space. The player must maneuver through the field and destroy the asteroids using the spaceship's laser gun. All asteroids begin as size large. When struck by a laser bullet, a large asteroid will split into two medium asteroids, which will each split into two small asteroids when hit. Small asteroids are completely destroyed after being stot. If the spaceship is struck by an asteroid, the game ends and the player has lost.

If the player manages to destroy all six asteroids and keep their spaceship intact, the game is won.

The spaceship and the asteroids are wrapped around the screen, meaning they cannot escape the area of the window. If one exits to the right, it will reappear on the left side of the screen. Bullets, however, do not wrap. They disappear once they exit the screen.
